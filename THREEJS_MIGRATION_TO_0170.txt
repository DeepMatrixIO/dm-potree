MIGRATION to THREEJS:

Reports


GLTF produce errors

Geometry was changed for BufferGeometry and its corresponding methods
SRGBEncoding for sRGCCololrspace
MAth was replaced by MathUtil.Math 


Existing Errors:

viewer.html works fine

ElevationProfile.html Works, but the Spheres do not show color.




features_sorvilier.js Start but requires loaders

gradient_colors.js Errors had errors on html. Fixed. box.getCenter added  an empty vector to operate and compute results		


light_ca_13.html pointcloud.vs got a temporary fix, so only the one shadowmap is being applied. The 


In HTML creates an Animation PAth which nos gets a BufferGeometry, uses it to create THREE.LineBasicMAterial, then  THREE.Line


load_project.html has issues with LineGeometry.LineSegmentsGeometry due to usage of instanced geometry, check it further


meshes.html does not work due to missing loaders

page.html works because is a catalog

toolbar does work due to Toolbars and Instanced Geometries, Tools do not work

360 works fine

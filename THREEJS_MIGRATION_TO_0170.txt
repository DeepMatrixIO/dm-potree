MIGRATION to THREEJS:

Reports


GLTF produce errors

Geometry was changed for BufferGeometry and its corresponding methods
SRGBEncoding for sRGCCololrspace
MAth was replaced by MathUtil.Math 


Existing Errors:

viewer.html works fine

ElevationProfile.html has errors, mostly for the geometry change, which requires set POSITON attribute from an array
and setting color from attribute.
Also does not worl due glsl shader







features_sorvilier.js Start but requires loaders

gradient_colors.js Errors on html 		
				e.pointcloud.updateMatrixWorld();
				let box = e.pointcloud.pcoGeometry.tightBoundingBox.clone();
				box.applyMatrix4(e.pointcloud.matrixWorld);
				let center = box.getCenter();  <---------- It has no volume, as its 0,0,0

light_ca_13.html also errors due glsl and AnimationPAth due Geometry to BufferGeometry errors
shadere requires an array and not receiving

In HTML creates an Animation PAth which nos gets a BufferGeometry, uses it to create THREE.LineBasicMAterial, then  THREE.Line


load_project.html has issues with LineGeometry.LineSegmentsGeometry due to usage of instanced geometry, check it further


meshes.html does not work due to missing loaders

page.html works because is a catalog

toolbar does work due to Toolbars and Instanced Geometries, Tools do not work

360 works fine

Annotations works fine

CameraAnimation has errors due to LineGeometry, as cannot instance it.

cesiumSorvellier works fine

customSidebarSection.html works fine

embedded_iframe works ok

ept.html works fine

geopackage does not load geopackage due LineMAterial errors. ShaderMaterial cannot be invoked without new

light.html Does not work due to animation errors

lion_laz.html works fine

matcap.html works fine

multiple_pointclouds work fine

viewer.html works fine

AnimationPAths work fine unlike othher animations   <----- Check it

Arena4D.html does not work.  PointCloudArena4DGeometrey is not defined

cesium_ca13.hrtml fine

classifications.html work fine

device_orientation.html workl fine


ept_binary.html fine


features_ca13.html does not work due to InstanceBufferGeomtry, LineSegmentsGeometry

light_animated.html Does not work. Shader Error on array viewer.js:375 Uncaught could not compile shader pointcloud: ERROR: 0:1079: '[' : array index for samplers must be constant integral expressions


lines.html Does not work due lines geometry

measurements.html does not work too

orientedImages does not work completely in Orientedimages.js Hay un elemento que es nulo.

shapefiles.html does not work due ShaderMAterial and LineMAterial


VR tampoco funciona

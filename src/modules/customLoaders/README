A terrain loader is created to retrieve tiled datasets

Using something like Potree.loadPointCloud , a custom loader is passed down an url and it decodes its config from a json file

We use the basis of POCLoader

which uses PointCloudOctreeGeometry
, which also download a json with configuration.

let xhr = XHRFactory.createXMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', url, true);
a custom function xhr.onreadystatechange is used to process the details.

and a callback to finally do something

In the load method attributes are retrieved and the corresponding

PointCLoudOctreeGeomerty is not a threejs Geoemntry, just a container
Each Node is a PointCLoudOctreeGeometryNode which is an specialization of PointCLoudThreeNode
